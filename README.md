Parkinson's Disease is a neurogenerative disorder that occurs in the case of elderly people. the
basic symptoms include like Tremor or rhythmic shaking, which usually begins in a limb, often
the hands or fingers, slowed movement (bradykinesia), rigid muscles, impaired posture, and
balance, loss of automatic movements, and change in speech and writing patterns. These basic
symptoms are similar to other neurogenerative disorders like Dementia; and due to this
more often, the patients are misdiagnosed. To address this, advanced techniques for Parkinson's
detection need to be developed. In this work, a classification model for detecting healthy
individuals with Parkinson's is proposed by integrating Image enhancement techniques
with a machine learning (SVM) model from handwritten image datasets.
